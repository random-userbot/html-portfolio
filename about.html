<p>I love chess . I consider these players as the greatest chess players . Their play is beautiful. Tal and Fischer's play is artistic , magnus crushes everyone with his strength. Magnus is the strongest chess player in history and he is alive. Tal is the magician, known for his unpredictable piece sacrifices. </p>
<p>Fischer is a strong attacker , he is the most influential chess player, defeated spassky in 1972 and won world chess championship. Tragically he stopped playing chess after winning the championship at the age of 29.</p>
